# Notes on Project Management

I've never formally studied PM. I've been practicing it empirically, on and off, for 20 years.

In this repository I will take notes on topics as I research them. If you chance upon this repo, feel free to open issues and even PRs. This is a public learning tool, you are welcome to be a part of it.

## Earned Value Management

This is from https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/earned-value-management-explained.php

### Budget at Completion (BAC)

BAC is the total cost of the project

### Budgeted Cost for Work Scheduled (BCWS) / Planned Value (PV)

Amount of work (in $ or time) according to the schedule

PV = BAC × % of planned work

### Budgeted Cost for Work Performed (BCWP) / Earned Value (EV)

Amount of work (in $ or time) performed

EV = BAC × % of work performed

### Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) / Actual Cost (AC)

Sum of all costs accrued for a task to date

###### In other words...

We should have completed US$800 of work by today. We completed US$600 of work. The BCWP is US$600. The BCWS is US$800. If we have paid US$700, the ACWP is US$700.

###### Example

A project has a budget of US$10 million and is scheduled to take 10 months. The budget is to be spent equally each month. After 2 months, the PM finds that 5% of the work is finished and US$1 million has been spent.

Planned Value (PV): US$2 million
Earned Value (EV): US$0.5 million
Actual Cost (AC): US$1 million
